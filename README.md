## Summary

**Node.js Jumpstart** is a sample repository that is used as an example for setting up a [**Node.js**][node] sample project.

There’s nothing complicated here. It is just a sample repository that does some basic mathematical computations (*like calculating the average of a list of numbers*).

In the future it *may* evolve to something more involve into a starter kit maybe. — Though for now, it is just a sample demo repository.
